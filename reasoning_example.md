# Granite 3.2 Reasoning

Granite 3.2 provided new capability like Thinking or reasoning. <TODO: add to>

## Reasoning Example

Lets ask `Granite 3.2 8b` model the following question `Find the fastest way for a seller to visit all the cities in their region` and then work towards how to ask how it reasoned or thought about its answer. 

### Prompt the model

Lets start with a simple sample code snippet below :

```py
import openai

api_key = "ollama"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1" # Ollama server hosting model
default_model = "granite3.2:8b"

openai_client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key
)

prompt = "Find the fastest way for a seller to visit all the cities in their region"

result = openai_client.completions.create(
    model=default_model,
    prompt=prompt,
)
results = []
print("\n\n")
for choice in result.choices:
    print(f"{choice.text}\n")
```

The model will generate output similar to the following:

```shell
To find the fastest route for a seller to visit all cities in their region, you're essentially looking for the solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). TSP is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, meaning there's no known efficient algorithm that can solve it exactly for large inputs. However, there are several approaches and heuristics that can provide near-optimal solutions:

1. **Exact Algorithms**: These methods guarantee finding the optimal solution but become impractical for a large number of cities due to their high computational complexity. Examples include branch and bound, dynamic programming, and integer linear programming formulations.

2. **Heuristic Methods**: These are faster than exact algorithms but do not guarantee an optimal solution. They're often used in practice because they can handle larger problem sizes. Some popular heuristics for TSP include:

   - **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: Start from a city and at each step, move to the nearest unvisited city until all cities have been visited. This is simple but not always efficient.
   
   - **2-Opt Algorithm**: Improve an initial tour by repeatedly swapping two edges if it results in a shorter tour.
   
   - **3-Opt Algorithm**: Similar to 2-Opt, but considers three edges for possible swap.
   
   - **Genetic Algorithms**: These are evolutionary algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection. They work with a population of candidate solutions and iteratively improve them through processes like mutation, crossover, and selection.
   
   - **Simulated Annealing**: This is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It's particularly useful when dealing with large, complex problems where local optima are common.

3. **Approximation Algorithms**: These provide solutions that are guaranteed to be within a certain factor of the optimal solution. The Christofides algorithm is an example, providing a tour no longer than 1.5 times the length of the minimum spanning tree plus the edge weights connecting the remaining vertices.

4. **Specialized Software and APIs**: There are software tools and online services that can solve TSP instances efficiently using advanced algorithms or by leveraging cloud computing power. Examples include Concorde TSP Solver, Google OR-Tools, and various web-based TSP solvers.

To implement these methods effectively:

1. **Data Preparation**: Gather accurate distance data between all city pairs. This can be done using geographical coordinates and a suitable distance calculation method (e.g., Haversine formula for spherical Earth).

2. **Choose an Approach**: Depending on the number of cities, computational resources, and required solution quality, select an appropriate method or combination of methods.

3. **Implementation**: Implement the chosen approach using a suitable programming language (e.g., Python, Java) or leverage existing software/APIs.

4. **Optimization**: Fine-tune parameters and potentially combine multiple approaches to improve solution quality and efficiency.

5. **Validation**: Verify the results by comparing them with other methods or known optimal solutions for smaller instances.
```

This is great but I'd like to better understand the model's thinking or reasoning behind he answer it provided. It might be just me but I'm a curious type!
Follow onto the next example on how to ask the model about their thinking.

### Prompt model and ask for reasoning on the answer

This time when we ask the question `Find the fastest way for a seller to visit all the cities in their region`, lets also ask the model how it arrived at its answer:

```py
import openai

api_key = "ollama"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1" # Ollama server hosting model
default_model = "granite3.2:8b"

openai_client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key
)

# prompt = "Find the fastest way for a seller to visit all the cities in their region"

prompt = """<|start_of_role|>system<|end_of_role|>Knowledge Cutoff Date: April 2024.

result = openai_client.completions.create(
    model=default_model,
    prompt=prompt,
    temperature=0.0,
)
results = []
print("\n\n")
for choice in result.choices:
    print(f"{choice.text}\n")
```

Now the response from the model is far more detailed and nuanced around how it arrived at its answer:

```shell
Here is my thought process:

The problem described seems to be a variant of the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is an NP-hard optimization problem. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the origin city. However, finding the absolute optimal solution for a large number of cities is computationally intensive and impractical due to its exponential time complexity. 

Given this, we need to consider heuristic or approximation algorithms that can provide a "good enough" solution in a reasonable amount of time. Common methods include:

1. Nearest Neighbor Algorithm: Start from a city and at each step, move to the nearest unvisited city. This is simple but not guaranteed to find the best route.

2. Genetic Algorithms or Simulated Annealing: These are more sophisticated metaheuristic methods that can provide near-optimal solutions for larger datasets but require careful tuning of parameters and computational resources.

3. Christofides Algorithm: This is a specific algorithm designed to find a route within twice the optimal, making it efficient for certain types of problems.

Considering the need for speed, we might lean towards simpler methods like Nearest Neighbor or more complex but potentially faster methods like Genetic Algorithms, depending on the number of cities and computational resources available. 

Here is my response:

To find the fastest way for a seller to visit all cities in their region (a problem similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem - TSP), we need to balance optimality with computational efficiency. Given the constraint of speed, here's a suggested approach:

1. **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: This is a straightforward heuristic method that can provide a quick solution. Hereâ€™s how it works:

   - Start from any city (let's call this City A).
   - From City A, go to the nearest unvisited city (City B).
   - From City B, go to the nearest unvisited city (could be City C, D, etc.).
   - Continue this process until all cities are visited.
   - The route ends by returning to the starting city (City A).

This method is fast and easy to implement but doesn't guarantee the shortest possible route. It's a good choice when speed is crucial and approximate solutions are acceptable.

2. **Genetic Algorithm**: For potentially better results, you could use a more sophisticated approach like Genetic Algorithms:

   - **Initialization**: Randomly select a set of initial routes (each representing a 'chromosome' in genetic terms).
   - **Fitness Function**: Define a fitness function that evaluates how 'good' each route is (e.g., total distance). The goal is to minimize this value.
   - **Selection, Crossover, Mutation**: These are the core operations of Genetic Algorithms:
     - Selection: Choose routes for reproduction based on their fitness scores. Better routes have a higher chance of being selected.
     - Crossover: Combine parts of two routes to create new ones.
     - Mutation: Randomly alter some routes to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence.
   - **Termination**: Repeat the selection, crossover, and mutation steps over several generations until you reach a satisfactory solution or a predefined computational limit.

Genetic Algorithms can provide better solutions than Nearest Neighbor but require more computational resources and careful parameter tuning.

3. **Christofides Algorithm**: This is a specific algorithm designed to find a route within twice the optimal for certain types of problems (Euclidean TSP in metric spaces). It's efficient and provides near-optimal results, but its implementation can be complex.

**Considerations**:

- The number of cities: For a very small number (<20), Nearest Neighbor might suffice. For larger datasets, more sophisticated methods like Genetic Algorithms or Christofides (if applicable) would be preferable.
  
- Computational resources: Simpler methods require less computational power but may provide less optimal results. More complex algorithms can offer better solutions at the cost of increased processing time and memory usage.

- Time constraints: If time is of the essence, a quick approximation (like Nearest Neighbor) might be preferred over a more computationally intensive method that guarantees better, though not necessarily the best, solution.

In conclusion, the 'fastest' method depends on the specific context and requirements of the problem at hand. For a swift yet approximate solution, the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is recommended. For situations where slightly better results are acceptable and more computational resources are available, Genetic Algorithms would be a suitable choice.
```

Now,  we are given "Thinking" of the model behind the answer in-addition to the answer or response. Exactly what we asked for. 

However, in the code snippet above you can see that we had to make a substantial and intricate change to the prompt for the model to receive its "Thinking" in the response. This is not something we want to have to do every time we want better understanding of an answer from the model.  Wouldn't it be great if we could be abstracted from this and only require to provide the question or prompt. This is where the [granite-io library](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-io) comes into play. Follow onto the next section to see how it can simplify your task.

### Use granite-io to help prompting the model

Lets now look at how the code snippet looks when using `granite-io` library to do the heavy lifting:

```
from granite_io import make_backend, make_io_processor
from granite_io.types import ChatCompletionInputs, UserMessage

model_name = "granite3.2:8b"
io_processor = make_io_processor(
    model_name, backend=make_backend("openai", {"model_name": model_name})
)
question = "Find the fastest way for a seller to visit all the cities in their region"
messages = [UserMessage(content=question)]

# With Thinking
outputs = io_processor.create_chat_completion(
    ChatCompletionInputs(messages=messages, thinking=True)
)
print("------ WITH THINKING ------")
print(">> Thoughts:")
print(outputs.results[0].next_message.reasoning_content)
print(">> Response:")
print(outputs.results[0].next_message.content)
```

The output returned from the model can now be broken up, thanks to how the library returns it:

```shell
------ WITH THINKING ------

>> Thoughts:
This problem seems to be a variant of the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the origin. However, the question asks for the "fastest" way, which suggests we might need to consider additional factors like road conditions, traffic patterns, real-time updates, etc., than just geographical distance. 

To solve this effectively, I'd need to incorporate elements of optimization algorithms (like Genetic Algorithms or Ant Colony Optimization typically used for TSP), real-time data feed integration (for traffic information), and perhaps machine learning models to predict optimal routes based on historical data.

Given the complexity, creating a fully functional system would require developing software and integrating various APIs, which is beyond the scope of this platform. Instead, I'll outline a high-level approach and suggest existing tools or services that can be utilized.

>> Response:
To find the fastest way for a seller to visit all cities in their region, you'd essentially want to solve a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), considering factors beyond just geographical distance such as real-time traffic conditions. Hereâ€™s a high-level approach to tackle this:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data for all cities in the region including their exact locations (latitude and longitude) and any initial known information about road infrastructure. 

2. **Real-Time Traffic Integration**: Incorporate real-time traffic data. This can be achieved by integrating APIs from services like Google Maps API, HERE Routing API, or OpenStreetMap with Overpass Turbo, which all offer robust traffic and route optimization features. These tools not only provide distance and time for different routes but also account for current traffic conditions.

3. **Historical Traffic Data**: Utilize historical data to predict future traffic patterns. Machine learning models, such as regression or neural network models, can be trained on past traffic data to forecast optimal travel times at different times of the day/week.

4. **Route Optimization Algorithm**: Implement an optimization algorithm. Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, or even simpler algorithms like nearest neighbor combined with 2-opt improvement can be used here. These will help in finding the most efficient route considering traffic conditions and possibly other constraints (like avoiding toll roads, certain routes due to construction etc.).

5. **Iterative Refinement**: Start with a preliminary route, perhaps generated by a heuristic method (like nearest neighbor), then iteratively refine it using the optimization algorithm, recalculating based on updated real-time traffic information.

6. **Consider Vehicle Specifics**: If possible, factor in specific vehicle details like average speed, fuel efficiency (to minimize stops) if aiming to minimize travel time/cost instead of just distance.

7. **User Interface**: Finally, create a user-friendly interface where the seller can input destinations and receive optimized routes. This could be a mobile app or a web application, providing options like daily re-planning based on updated traffic forecasts.

While it's not feasible to develop such a system in this text-based environment, the outlined strategy provides a roadmap for software developers looking to create a solution for efficient city-to-city travel planning, integrating real-time data and optimization techniques.

## What value does the `granite-io` library give you?

Well, if we use the example of questioning the model about the `Find the fastest way for a seller to visit all the cities in their region`, and also asking how it arrived at its answer:

- Input Processor: Require setting parameter `thinking=True` and the library will generate the prompt required for the model to understand that it needs to also provide Thinking/Reasoning. Remember the ugly prompt! Input Processor)
- Output Processor: It parses the model output and separates the thinking and response parts for you
- IO Processor: It wraps the input and output capability in 1 processor for you. **Note:** the library will also provide the capability to use input processors and output processor independent of the IO processor.
